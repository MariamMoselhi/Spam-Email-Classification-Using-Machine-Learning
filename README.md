Project Description: Spam Email Classification Using Machine Learning


Objective:

The project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying emails as either spam or ham (non-spam). The goal is to build an effective spam detection system using text processing and classification techniques.

Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is the "Spam Emails" dataset from Kaggle, which contains labeled emails as spam (1) or ham (0).

Methodology:

Data Loading and Inspection:

The dataset was loaded, and basic inspection was performed to understand its structure and check for missing values.
Data Cleaning:

Duplicate entries were removed to ensure data quality.
Email categories were mapped to numeric values (1 for spam and 0 for ham).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

The distribution of spam and ham emails was visualized using count plots.
Digit analysis was conducted to determine the percentage of digits in spam and ham emails, highlighting a common feature of spam messages.
Text Preprocessing:

Text Cleaning: Special characters were removed, and text was converted to lowercase.
Tokenization: The cleaned text was tokenized into individual words.
Stopword Removal: Common English stopwords were removed from the tokenized text.
Lemmatization: Words were lemmatized to reduce them to their root forms, enhancing the model's ability to understand text meaning.
Feature Extraction:

TF-IDF Vectorization: Text data was transformed into numerical features using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to capture the importance of words.
Data Balancing:

To address class imbalance, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was used to generate synthetic samples of the minority class (spam), balancing the dataset.
Model Development:

A Logistic Regression model was built and trained using the processed data.
The data was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Model Evaluation:

The model's performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix.
The evaluation showed that the model effectively classified spam and ham emails, demonstrating its suitability for spam detection tasks.
Results:

The Logistic Regression model achieved a high accuracy score, indicating that it can reliably distinguish between spam and ham emails.
The classification report showed balanced performance across precision, recall, and F1-score, confirming the model's robustness.
Conclusion:
The project successfully developed a spam classification model that uses a combination of text preprocessing, feature extraction, data balancing, and machine learning. This model can be utilized in email systems to automatically filter out unwanted spam messages, enhancing user experience and security.
